# COVID-Mental-Health-Companion
In the times of Coronavirus we all are advised to stay home to fight against COVID-19.

This has led to dearth of Social Interaction which has contributed to bad Mental Health as humans are afterall social animals.

The application developed is a simple attempt to convey the concept of using tech to help with mental health. The application listens to people, which is what most people need, and generates a mental health profile report of the person to be sent to mental health professionals. This helps with more accessibility and availability of mental support to all people.

Open the "Main_File_Open_This.ipynb" file to check out how it works.

Note : The application in no way perfectly analyses mental health and isn't meant for practical and daily use as of now.
